Welcome, this is Kent's portfolio account.

Here you can find repositories that I created during my undergraduate studies at Davis.
I did not include all of my work, rather notable ones that should highlight my abilities as a coder and developer.
I decided to reorganize and port over these repositories due to my university account's pending closure (post-graduation).

I have an educational background in low-level coding and electronics, and I have practical experience with IT systems, including networks and websites.
I aim to continue in a low-level software realm, where I can utilize my combined understandings of hardware and higher abstraction layers.
I am currently reading through concepts in cybersecurity, as well as guides on Kubernetes to enhance my potential contributions in an enterprise setting.

I am looking for work. Please hire me!
